- Basic image processing operations: filtering, transformation, and enhancement
- Advanced techniques such as noise reduction, edge detection, and restoration
- Examples and demos for each feature

## Requirements

This project requires MATLAB with the following toolboxes:

- Image Processing Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox (if applicable)

Ensure that you have the required toolboxes installed in your MATLAB environment.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kilcimurat/Image_Processing_Matlab.git
    cd Image_Processing_Matlab
    ```

2. **Open MATLAB and set the project directory:**

    ```matlab
    cd 'path_to_your_cloned_repository/Image_Processing_Matlab'
    ```

3. **Add the project directory to the MATLAB path:**

    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('path_to_your_cloned_repository/Image_Processing_Matlab'))
    ```

## Usage

You can run the various image processing scripts directly from the MATLAB command window or as part of a larger project.
